A **react hook** for using error boundaries in your functional components.


It lets you keep track of the error state of child components, by wrapping them in a provided `ErrorBoundary` component.

### Installation

```bash
npm i use-error-boundary
```

## Examples and usage

Import the hook:
```javascript
// Named
import { useErrorBoundary } from 'use-error-boundary'
// Default
import useErrorBoundary from 'use-error-boundary'
```

Use the hook in your react component,
it provides you with this object:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {

  const {
    ErrorBoundary, // class - The react component to wrap your children in. This WILL NOT CHANGE
    didCatch, // boolean - Whether the ErrorBoundary catched something
    error, // null or the error
    errorInfo // null or the error info as described in the react docs
  } = useErrorBoundary()

  ...
  
}
```

Wrap your components in the `ErrorBoundary`:

```javascript

const JustRenderMe = () => {
  throw new Error('ðŸ’¥')
}

const MyComponent = () => {

  ...

  /**
   * The ErrorBoundary renders its children directly,
   * when a component throws, the ErrorBoundary will return null from its render method.
   * 
   * See TODO section :)
   */
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <JustRenderMe />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

## TODO

 - [ ] Extend default ErrorBoundary component to render a provided component when there is an error
 - [ ] Passing own component as ErrorBoundary and wrap it
 - [ ] Change `createErrorBoundaryClass` to pass `onDidCatch` as prop (HOC)
 - [ ] Cleanup tests
